Compiled and structured data into an Excel sheet.

Ensured consistency in formats (CSV, XLSX, etc.).

2️⃣ Manual Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Removed duplicates, inconsistencies, and missing values.

Standardized date formats, numeric values, and text cases.

Applied Excel functions for initial data corrections.

3️⃣ AI-Powered Optimization (Prompt Engineering)
Utilized ChatGPT, Gemini, and DeepSeek to:

Automate repetitive tasks (e.g., column formatting, formula generation).

Enhance text processing (e.g., entity extraction, data validation).

Generate structured prompts for advanced data cleaning.

Example Prompts Used:

"Provide an optimized Excel formula to clean missing values in a dataset."

"Suggest a Power Query transformation for standardizing date formats."

"Analyze this dataset and detect anomalies or outliers."

4️⃣ Final Review & Quality Check
Ensured data accuracy post-processing.

Verified AI-generated transformations for correctness.

Prepared a clean dataset for visualization and reporting.

🎯 Key Benefits
✅ Faster data cleaning with AI-assisted insights.
✅ Improved accuracy through intelligent validation.
✅ Streamlined preprocessing for better analytics.

Second  Task 
🎓 College TPO Data Collection & Cleaning with AI
📌 Project Overview
This project involves manually collecting Training & Placement Officer (TPO) data for 2,000 colleges and ensuring the data is structured, accurate, and properly formatted. To improve efficiency, AI-powered tools like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and DeepSeek were used for data validation, prompt-based analysis, and automation of repetitive tasks.

🔄 Workflow & Challenges
1️⃣ Data Collection (Manual Entry)
Gathered TPO contact details, college names, locations, and other key attributes.

Ensured proper structuring of columns and standardized naming conventions.

Faced challenges like inconsistent formats, missing data, and duplicate entries.

2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Standardization
Removed duplicate and incomplete records.

Verified contact details and college names for accuracy.

Standardized text case, phone number formats, and address structures.

3️⃣ AI-Assisted Processing (Prompt Engineering)
Leveraged ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and DeepSeek for:

Data Validation: AI-assisted checking of missing or incorrect values.

Search Optimization: AI-generated structured queries for better data extraction.

Automated Formatting: AI-generated Excel formulas for quick corrections.

Example AI Prompts Used:

"Generate an Excel formula to find and correct inconsistently formatted phone numbers."

"Suggest a method to validate missing college email addresses in bulk."

"Provide a structured way to categorize colleges by state using Excel or Power Query."

4️⃣ Final Review & Performance Optimization
Ensured that all collected data was accurate, clean, and properly structured.

Used Excel formulas, pivot tables, and filters to validate dataset completeness.

Prepared the dataset for further analysis, visualization, and reporting.

🎯 Key Outcomes & Benefits
✅ High-quality structured TPO data for 2,000 colleges.
✅ AI-driven enhancements for faster, more efficient data processing.
✅ Reduced manual effort by automating repetitive data validation tasks.
✅ Optimized dataset for easy search, filter, and analysis
